# Specification Quality Checklist: Autonomous Workflow System for Content Creation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - Specification is complete and ready for planning

**Clarifications Resolved**:
- Q1: Cost tracking post-execution only (no pre-estimates or caps in v1)
- Q2: Node-level summary logs (balanced approach)
- Q3: Explicit "Attach to Document" node for workflow-controlled attachments

**Next Steps**: Ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.tasks`
